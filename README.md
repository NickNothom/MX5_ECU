# MX5_ECU

This is the code that runs the engine in my MX5. It's a 1991 1.6L B6ZE with a MegaSquirt 2 ECU. I spent a couple months teaching myself how to tune it and this is the result of that. 

Still need to work out some issues with air intake temperature sensing, as my sensor gets heat soaked on warm days. 


## Log:

### 20170211

Swapped injectors to 420cc RX8 Yellows.

### 20170212

Adjusted accel enrichment, warmup enrichment. Aiming to solve lean condition after startup and warmup.
